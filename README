NAME
    Sys::Signal - Set signal handlers with restoration of existing C
    sighandler

SYNOPSIS
      use Sys::Signal ();
      eval {    
          my $h = Sys::Signal->set(ALRM => sub { die "timeout\n" });    
          alarm $timeout;   
          ... do something thay may timeout ...
          alarm 0;    
      };    
      die $@ if $@;

DESCRIPTION
    The *Sys::Signal* *set* method works much like `local $SIG{FOO}', but
    with the added functionality of restoring the underlying signal handler
    to the previous C function, rather than Perl's. Unless, of course,
    Perl's C signal handler was the previous handler.
